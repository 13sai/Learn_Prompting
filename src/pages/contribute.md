This site is **open source** and contributions are extremely welcome. 
You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/trigaten/Learn_Prompting),
along with many [open issues](https://github.com/trigaten/Learn_Prompting/issues). 
Please reach out at learnprompting@gmail.com if you have any questions.

In particular, we are looking for help with:

## 1. Site design and layout

We have a number of open issues on ease of use feature for the site, such as https://github.com/trigaten/Learn_Prompting/issues/10.

## 2. Content

This could be reading new prompt engineering papers and writing pages about them,
or writing articles on more anecdotal topics. Most all content is welcome. See open
issues for papers we have yet to add.

Something important to not when adding content is that we try to write articles 
on techniques rather than papers. This means that multiple techniques used in a paper
could be spread across multiple articles. The reasoning for this is, in part, that
papers often reuse techniques, and we want to avoid repeating ourselves. Additionally,
articles on bite sized, single techniques are easier to read and understand.

## 3. Miscl.

Everything from fixing typos to recommendations for the site (suggest papers, 
layout changes, tell us what you want to learn about, etc.)

We need help maintaining the list of prompt engineering tools and products that use prompting.
