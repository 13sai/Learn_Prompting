Please reach out at learnprompting@gmail.com if you have any questions.

In particular, we are looking for help with:

## 1. Site design and layout

We have a number of open issues on ease of use feature for the site, such as https://github.com/trigaten/Learn_Prompting/issues/10.

## 2. Content

This could be reading new prompt engineering papers and writing pages about them,
or writing articles on more anecdotal topics. Most all content is welcome. See open
issues for papers we have yet to add.

## 3. Miscl.

Everything from fixing typos to recommendations for the site (suggest papers, 
layout changes, tell us what you want to learn about, etc.)
