# MRKL

MRKL Systems(@karpas2022mrkl) (Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language, pronounced "miracle") 
are a neuro-symbolic architecture that combine LLMs (neural computation) and external 
tools like calculators (symbolic computation) 
to solve complex problems. A simple example of a MRKL system is a LLM that can 
use a calculator app. When asked, "What is 100*100?", the LLM can choose to
extract the numbers from the prompt, and then use the calculator app to compute
the result.
