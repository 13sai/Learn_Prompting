# ðŸŸ¢ Style Modifiers

Style modifiers are simply descriptors which consistently
produce certain styles (e.g. 'green tinted', 'on stained glass', '\#pixelart')(@oppenlaender2022taxonomy). They can be combined together to
produce even more specific styles. They can "include information about art periods, schools, and styles, but also art materials and media, techniques, and artists"(@oppenlaender2022taxonomy).
