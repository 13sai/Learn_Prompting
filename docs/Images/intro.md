# Intro to Image Prompting

Figuring our the best prompt to create a perfect image is a particular challenge.
Research into methods to do so is not quite as developed as text prompting. This
may be due to inherent challenges in creating things which are fundamentally subjective
and often lack good accuracy metrics. However, fear not, as the image prompting 
community has made great discoveries about how to prompt image models(@rombach2021highresolution)(@ramesh2022hierarchical).


## Example

Here I will go through an example of how I created the images for this course. 
I had been experimenting with low poly style for a deep reinforcement learning
neural radiance field project. I liked the low poly style, and wanted to use it 
for this course's images. 

I did a bunch of research into how to create low poly images, on r/StableDiffusion 
and other sites, but couldn't find anything super helpful.

I decided to just start with `Low poly white and blue rocket shooting to the moon in front of a sparse green meadow` and see what happened.
