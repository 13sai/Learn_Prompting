# Welcome

Welcome to this course on Prompt Engineering! 

I like to think of PE as "**How to talk 
to AI to get it to do what you want**". With many of the recent advances in AI,
this is a particularly important skill to have.

This course is designed for both 
ML (machine learning) hobbyists and researchers, with a particular focus on undergraduate researchers
who often fall somewhere in between. As such, this course focuses on applied techniques, at the 
expense of some of the more mathematical aspects of PE. Since PE is such an applied field,
we aren't missing all that much ðŸ˜Š

## Course Philosophy

**Quick Iterations** - Since new PE content is published almost daily, 
I will update this course frequently with short articles about new techniques.
Let me know what you want to hear more about!

**Examples ASAP** - I try to put examples in the articles as soon as possible,
so that you can get a feel for the techniques as soon as possible.

I'll philosophize more about this when I have time to ðŸ˜Š

## How to read

It is not necessary to read all chapters in order. Read what interests you!

That being said, [Basics](/docs/category/tutorial---basics-) is a good place to start,
and it discusses some very simple, but powerful, prompt engineering techniques.
