# Intro to Prompt Engineering


Although familiarity with LLMs, MLMs and the concept of prompts is mostly assumed,
I will provide a short introduct to each concept here. Prompting is defined as
"converting tasks into a language model format" [[1]](#1). There are many examples
of prompt engineering strategies...[[2]](#2)
