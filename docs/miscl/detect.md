# ðŸŸ¢ Detecting AI Generated Text

Detecting AI generated text is a big problem for safety researchers and educators,
among others. Tools like [GPTZero](https://gptzero.me) have seen siginificant success,
However, they can [be tricked](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1610552172038737920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw). Additionally, by running an open source model and modifying it's
output probabilities, text will likely be much harder to detect.

Companies like OpenAI are working to introduce statistical watermarking into their
generated text, but this too can be fooled by modifying large portions of the text.

The problem of AI text detection will likely be an arms race as new models and 
new detection methods are introduced. Many companies have already started to 
build solutions which they claim are very effective, but it is difficult to prove
this, especially over time.

## Philosophy

Educators are very interested in this technology to prevent cheating, but some 
Internet commenters and other educators have expressed that they believe students
should be allowed to use these tools.
