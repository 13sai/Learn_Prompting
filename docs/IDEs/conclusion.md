# Conclusion ðŸš§

This page will be updated as I get access to more IDEs. If you know of any IDEs that I should add, please let me know!

This chapter has provided an overview of some of the tools which may be of interest to
you as a prompt engineer. Below are my recommendations for which to use, and in 
what capacity. Keep in mind that prompt engineering is a rapidly evolving field, and
many of the previously mentioned tools will undergo signifigant changes in the future.

## For Advanced Prompt Chaining

Dust is currently the best tool for advanced prompt chaining. It provides a very 
robust feature set.


## For Single Prompt Iterating

Everyprompt seems to have the best feature set for single prompt iterating (from the IDEs I have been able to try).

## More

I will be adding more recommendations as I get access to more IDEs. I recommend 
trying out different ones, as each has a distinct feel and different features.
