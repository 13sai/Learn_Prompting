# Overview

Prompt engineering is an iterative design task. More formalized iterative design
fields (e.g. logo design) have well established tooling which allows designers to
be more efficient. Similar tooling exists in the prompt engineering space, with
a variety of prompt engineering IDEs (integrated development environments) having 
been recently created. There exists a surprising range of such tooling, with everything
from research interfaces to professionally designs IDEs coming into existence recently.
This chapter will provide an overview of some of the tools which may be of interest to
you as a prompt engineer.

See the final article in this chapter for my recommendations on tools to use.


Here is a table of the tools we will be discussing in this chapter:

\* LangChain is a Python library for prompt engineering. It's main interface is a Jupyter notebook.

**Research Focused**: The tool is designed for research purposes, and may not be as
user friendly as other tools.

**Business Model**: Type of business model. Left blank if unknown.
