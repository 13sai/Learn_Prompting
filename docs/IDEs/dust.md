# Dust 

[Dust](https://dust.tt/) is a prompt engineering built for chaining prompts together. They provide 
a web interface for writing prompts and chaining them together. 

At the moment, it has a steep learning curve compared to other prompt engineering
IDEs.

## Features

Dust provides robust tooling in the form of a number of composable "blocks", for 
functions like LLM querying, code snippets, and internet searches. Dust also supports 
the usse of datasets and automateically testing prompts against datasets. 

Current Dust functionality focuses on chaining prompts rather than iterating on a single prompt.
