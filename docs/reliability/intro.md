# Intro

This chapter covers how to make completions more reliabile, as well as how to 
implement checks to ensure that outputs are reliable. To a certain extent, most
of the previous tecniques have have covered have to do with improving completion
accuracy, and thus reliability, in particular Self-consistency(@wang2022selfconsistency).
However, there are a number of other techniques that can be used to improve reliability,
beyond prompting strategies.

In particular, we will discuss tecniques such as calibrators, verifiers, and approaches
to introduce diversity in completions.
